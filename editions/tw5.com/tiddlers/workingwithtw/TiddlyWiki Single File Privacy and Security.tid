!!! Single File Configuration

As a practical matter, using ~TiddlyWiki in the single file configuration depends upon keeping that file secure and private.  Users can employ the same tools that they use to keep any document and photograph secure. For many users, the simplest solution will be to use an existing file storage service such as [[Google Drive|https://drive.google.com]], [[Apple's iCloud|https://www.icloud.com]], or [[Dropbox|https://www.dropbox.com]]. Many users already rely on the privacy and security of these services.  There are also open source alternatives such as [[Syncthing|https://syncthing.net/]] that allow users to synchronise files between their devices without using a third party service.

Users may wish to use additional layers of security. ~TiddlyWiki in the single file configuration offers built-in encryption using an industry standard encryption library to offer AES 128-bit encryption in CCM mode. All the data within the file is encrypted and cannot be accessed without entering the correct password. The password is never stored in the file, and so if it is lost, the data is lost. Instructions can be found in [[Encryption]].

It is important to understand that ~TiddlyWiki's built in encryption is our best endeavour to offer privacy and usability. However, the encryption feature has not been subject to the kind of rigorous third party testing that characterises secure services like Signal or Syncthing.  Cautious users may wish to use ~TiddlyWiki's built in encryption as an extra layer of security, but should take care not to rely on it as one would rely on industry standard encryption solutions that have been rigorously tested in a variety of situations.
